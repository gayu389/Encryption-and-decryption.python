Encryption and Decryption Tool

Overview:
This program is a Python-based tool designed to secure sensitive data by converting plain text into an encrypted format and vice versa. It leverages robust cryptographic libraries to ensure that the data remains confidential and tamper-proof during storage or transmission.

Key Features:

Encryption Functionality:
Converts user-provided plain text into a cipher text using a secure encryption algorithm (e.g., symmetric encryption with a shared key). This makes the data unreadable without the corresponding key.

Decryption Functionality:
Reverts the cipher text back into its original plain text format using the same key. This ensures that authorized users can access the original content when needed.

User Input Handling:
Accepts data through command-line arguments or user prompts, allowing flexibility in how text is provided for encryption or decryption.

Error Handling and Validation:
Includes mechanisms to verify the validity of input data and keys, providing error messages when inputs are incorrect or missing.

Modular Code Structure:
Designed with separate functions for encryption and decryption, making it easier to maintain and extend the program (e.g., adding support for file encryption).


Usage:

Encryption: The user inputs a plain text message along with a key. The program encrypts the message and outputs the resulting cipher text.

Decryption: The user provides the cipher text and the key. The program decrypts the cipher text back to its original plain text form.


Potential Enhancements:

File Handling: Extend the tool to encrypt and decrypt files instead of just text input.

GUI Integration: Incorporate a graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.

Advanced Cryptography: Integrate additional encryption methods (e.g., RSA for public-key encryption) for enhanced security options.


Security Considerations:
While the program uses standard encryption algorithms, it's important to manage keys securely. The tool can serve as a base for learning about encryption and as a component in larger systems where data security is paramount.
